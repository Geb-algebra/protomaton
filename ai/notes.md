# Implementation Status

*This file tracks the current implementation progress and should be updated regularly during development.*

## Completed
- Initial protomaton workflow setup
- Created shell scripts and Claude commands  
- Set up document templates and directory structure
- Complete todo app specification and design documentation
- Domain models and services skeleton (Task entity with business rules)
- React Router routes configuration for todo app (/todos, /todos/new, /todos/:id)
- Route module templates with detailed documentation
- **COMPLETE TODO APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION:**
  - Domain layer: Task models, Repository, Factory, and business services
  - API layer: Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, toggle complete)
  - Route modules: List view (/todos), Create form (/todos/new), Detail/Edit view (/todos/:id)
  - UI components: Responsive design with shadcn/ui components and CSS modules
  - Form validation: Zod schemas for all user inputs with error handling
  - Local storage persistence: Tasks saved in browser localStorage
  - TypeScript compilation: All code properly typed and compiling successfully

## In Progress
- Final cleanup and documentation

## Next Steps
- Application is ready for use
- Can start creating and managing todo tasks
- Consider adding more advanced features like task categories, reminders, etc.

## Known Issues
- Minor linting warnings for CSS specificity and static IDs (not affecting functionality)
- Uses localStorage for persistence (data will be lost on browser data clear)
- No user authentication or multi-user support (single-user app)
- No data export/import functionality
