# Protomaton Implement Command

You are helping with the Protomaton implementation phase - building features according to specifications and designs.

## Your Task
Implement features following the current specifications and design documents, updating implementation notes as you progress.

## Process
1. **Read documentation**: Review current change history, specifications, and design documents
2. **Create/update notes**: Initialize or update `ai/notes.md` with:
   - What has been implemented so far
   - What you plan to implement next  
   - Known issues and blockers
3. **Implement incrementally**: Build features step by step, updating notes after each significant milestone
4. **Follow designs strictly**: Adhere to architecture decisions in design documents
5. **Update docs if needed**: If you discover the specs/designs are wrong, update them first

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Follow existing patterns**: Examine the codebase for conventions before adding new code
- **Use specified technologies**: Only use libraries and frameworks documented in system designs
- **Maintain code quality**: Follow linting, type checking, and testing requirements
- **Update notes frequently**: Keep `ai/notes.md` current for transparency

## Notes Format (`ai/notes.md`)
```markdown
# Implementation Status

## Completed
- [List implemented features/components]

## In Progress  
- [Current work item with details]

## Next Steps
- [Planned next implementation steps]

## Known Issues
- [Any blockers, technical debt, or problems]
```

## Important Notes
- Always implement according to design documents - don't improvise architecture
- If designs are insufficient, pause implementation and update design documents first
- Keep stakeholders informed through regular notes updates
- Run tests and builds to ensure quality

You can start implementing based on the instruction provided.
