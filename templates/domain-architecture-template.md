## Execution Flow (Domain Design)
```
1. Parse requirements from specifications
   ‚Üí If no related specs: ERROR "Domain design requires specifications"
2. Identify core business concepts
   ‚Üí Extract: entities, value objects, aggregates
3. For each unclear business rule:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Model domain objects and relationships
   ‚Üí Ensure proper encapsulation
   ‚Üí Define validation rules
5. Identify complex business logic (skip simple CRUD)
   ‚Üí Focus on calculations, constraints, workflows
6. Define domain events for cross-boundary communication
7. Run Constitution compliance checklist
   ‚Üí If violations found: ERROR "Fix constitution compliance"
8. Return: SUCCESS (domain design ready for implementation)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on business concepts and rules, not technical implementation
- ‚ùå Avoid persistence, UI, or infrastructure concerns
- üè¢ Reviewable by business stakeholders for domain correctness

### Section Requirements
- **Domain Objects**: Always required - core business entities
- **Business Logic**: Required only for complex operations (skip CRUD)
- **Validation Rules**: Required when business constraints exist
- **Domain Events**: Optional - for cross-boundary communication

### For AI Generation
When creating this domain design:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for unclear business rules
2. **Don't guess**: If business logic is ambiguous, mark it rather than assume
3. **Think like a domain expert**: Focus on business invariants and rules
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Business rule enforcement points
   - Data validation and constraints
   - Entity lifecycle management
   - Cross-aggregate consistency rules
   - Domain event triggers and data
   - Permission and authorization rules within domain

## Overview
<!-- Brief description of this domain and its responsibilities -->

## Domain Objects

### Entity: [Name]
<!-- Primary business entities -->
**Purpose**: [What this entity represents in the business domain]

**Key Attributes**:
- `field_name` (type) - Description and validation rules
- `field_name` (type) - Description and validation rules

**Relationships**:
- [Relationship type] with [Other Entity] - Description

### Value Object: [Name]  
<!-- Immutable objects that represent concepts -->
**Purpose**: [What this value object represents]

**Attributes**:
- `field_name` (type) - Description and validation rules

**Validation Rules**:
- Rule 1: [Constraint description]
- Rule 2: [Constraint description]

## Business Logic

### Complex Operations
<!-- Only include non-trivial business operations, skip simple CRUD -->

#### Operation: [Name]
**Purpose**: [What business problem this solves]  
**Inputs**: [Required data]  
**Logic**: [High-level algorithm or business rules]  
**Outputs**: [Results produced]  
**Constraints**: [Business rules that must be maintained]

#### Operation: [Name]
**Purpose**: [What business problem this solves]  
**Inputs**: [Required data]  
**Logic**: [High-level algorithm or business rules]  
**Outputs**: [Results produced]  
**Constraints**: [Business rules that must be maintained]

## Domain Events
<!-- Important business events that other domains might need to know about -->

### Event: [Name]
**Triggered When**: [Condition that causes this event]  
**Data Included**: [Information carried by the event]  
**Consumers**: [Who needs to know about this event]

## Validation Rules
<!-- Domain-wide validation and business constraints -->

### Entity Validation
- [Entity Name]: [Validation rules]

### Business Constraints  
- [Constraint]: [Description and enforcement rules]

## Constitution Compliance Checklist
<!-- Verify adherence to constitution.md principles -->
- [ ] Domain objects are properly encapsulated
- [ ] Business logic is contained within the domain layer
- [ ] External dependencies are abstracted through interfaces
- [ ] Domain events are used for cross-boundary communication
- [ ] [Add other constitution.md requirements as applicable]
