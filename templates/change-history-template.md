# Change History: {{FILENAME}}

**Status**: Live  
**Created**: {{DATE}}  
**Description**: {{DESCRIPTION}}

## Execution Flow
```
1. Parse user description and project context
   ‚Üí If description too vague: ERROR "Need clearer feature description"
2. Identify scope of change
   ‚Üí New feature | Bug fix | Enhancement | Refactor
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Map to existing documentation
   ‚Üí Which specs need updates?
   ‚Üí Which designs are affected?
5. Identify new documentation needs
   ‚Üí What new specs/designs are needed?
6. Plan documentation sequence
   ‚Üí Dependencies between documents
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Change scope has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If missing key documents: ERROR "Critical documentation missing"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT documentation needs to be created/updated
- ‚ùå Avoid implementation details or coding todos
- üìã Planning document for stakeholder alignment

### Section Requirements
- **Overview**: Always required - clear change summary
- **Documentation Updates**: Always required - specific file impacts
- **Notes**: Optional - additional context or constraints

### For AI Generation
When creating this change history:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption about scope
2. **Don't guess**: If unclear what documents are affected, mark it rather than assume
3. **Think systematically**: Consider all document types (spec, domain, ui, system)
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Integration points with existing features
   - User permission/role impacts
   - Data migration or compatibility needs
   - Performance/scale considerations
   - Security/compliance implications
   - Cross-feature dependencies
