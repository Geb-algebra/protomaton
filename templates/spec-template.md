## Execution Flow (Specification Creation)
```
1. Parse user description from change history/input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Primary User Story
<!-- The main value proposition from the user's perspective -->
As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit].

## Acceptance Scenarios
<!-- Specific testable scenarios that define success -->

### Scenario 1: [Name]
**Given** [initial conditions]  
**When** [user action]  
**Then** [expected outcome]

### Scenario 2: [Name]
**Given** [initial conditions]  
**When** [user action]  
**Then** [expected outcome]

## Edge Cases
<!-- Error conditions, boundary cases, and failure modes -->

### Error Handling
- **Case**: [Error condition]
  - **Expected**: [How system should respond]

### Boundary Conditions  
- **Case**: [Boundary condition]
  - **Expected**: [Expected behavior]

## Functional Requirements
<!-- What the system must do - avoid technical implementation details -->

### Core Requirements
1. The system must [requirement]
2. The system must [requirement]  
3. The system must [requirement]

### Business Rules
1. [Business rule or constraint]
2. [Business rule or constraint]

## Key Entities
<!-- Important data objects and their relationships -->

### Entity: [Name]
- **Purpose**: [What this represents]
- **Key Attributes**: [Important fields/properties]
- **Relationships**: [How it relates to other entities]

### Entity: [Name]  
- **Purpose**: [What this represents]
- **Key Attributes**: [Important fields/properties]
- **Relationships**: [How it relates to other entities]

## Success Criteria
<!-- How to measure if this specification is properly implemented -->
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios pass
- [ ] All edge cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] All functional requirements are met
- [ ] All business rules are enforced
