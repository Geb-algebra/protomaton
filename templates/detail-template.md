# Architectural Decision Record: {{NAME}}

**Created**: {{DATE}}  
**Last Updated**: {{DATE}}  
**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Superseded]

## Execution Flow (ADR Creation)
```
1. Identify specific architectural decision requiring documentation
   ‚Üí If decision too broad: ERROR "Break into specific decisions"
2. Research existing approaches and alternatives
3. For each unclear trade-off:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Analyze pros/cons of each alternative objectively
5. Document decision rationale with specific reasons
6. Identify implementation requirements and consequences
7. Link to related decisions and documents
8. Return: SUCCESS (ADR ready for review and acceptance)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on specific architectural decisions requiring justification
- ‚ùå Avoid general documentation or implementation guides
- üìö Permanent record of decision reasoning for future reference

### Section Requirements
- **Context & Decision**: Always required - what and why
- **Alternatives Considered**: Always required - options evaluated
- **Rationale**: Always required - specific decision factors
- **Consequences**: Always required - positive and negative impacts

### For AI Generation
When creating this ADR:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for unclear requirements or constraints
2. **Don't guess**: If trade-offs are unclear, mark them rather than assume
3. **Think like a architect**: Focus on long-term maintainability and consequences
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Performance requirements affecting the decision
   - Team expertise and learning curve considerations
   - Integration constraints with existing systems
   - Future scalability and evolution needs
   - Budget and timeline constraints
   - Regulatory or compliance requirements
