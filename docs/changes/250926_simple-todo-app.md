**Status**: Live  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Description**: create a simple todo app that has task list, create button, task edit in task detail page and delete, done/undone. each task has its name, priority and due date.

## Execution Flow
```
1. Parse user description and project context
   ‚Üí New feature - Complete todo application with CRUD operations
2. Identify scope of change
   ‚Üí New feature - Full-stack todo management system  
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Task priority values/enum options]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Due date format and timezone handling]
4. Map to existing documentation
   ‚Üí No existing specs need updates (new application)
   ‚Üí No existing designs affected (new feature)
5. Identify new documentation needs
   ‚Üí New domain design for Task entity
   ‚Üí New application design for todo UI components
   ‚Üí New specification for todo feature functionality
6. Plan documentation sequence
   ‚Üí Domain design first (Task entity)
   ‚Üí Application design second (UI components)
   ‚Üí Feature specification third (user workflows)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Change scope has uncertainties about priority enum and date handling"
8. Return: SUCCESS (change plan ready for execution)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT documentation needs to be created/updated
- ‚ùå Avoid implementation details or coding todos
- üìã Planning document for stakeholder alignment

### Section Requirements
- **Overview**: Always required - clear change summary
- **Documentation Updates**: Always required - specific file impacts
- **Notes**: Optional - additional context or constraints

### For AI Generation
When creating this change history:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption about scope
2. **Don't guess**: If unclear what documents are affected, mark it rather than assume
3. **Think systematically**: Consider all document types (spec, domain, ui, system)
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Integration points with existing features
   - User permission/role impacts
   - Data migration or compatibility needs
   - Performance/scale considerations
   - Security/compliance implications
   - Cross-feature dependencies

## Overview
Create a complete todo application with full CRUD functionality including:
- Task list view displaying all todos
- Create button and form for new tasks  
- Task detail page with edit capabilities
- Delete functionality for tasks
- Toggle done/undone status
- Each task contains: name, priority, and due date

This is a standalone feature that doesn't integrate with existing systems.

## Documentation Updates Required

### Specifications (app/feature)
- [ ] **todo/spec.md** - New - Define user workflows, UI behavior, and feature requirements for todo management

### Domain Designs (app/domain/ as self-documented codes) 
- [ ] **app/domain/task** - New - Task entity with models, lifecycle, and services for todo business logic

### Application Designs (app/)
- [ ] **app/feature/todo** - New - Todo UI components including list view, detail page, forms, and task components

### Technical Decisions (docs/adr/)
- [ ] **task-priority-enum.md** - New - Decision on priority values and implementation approach
- [ ] **due-date-handling.md** - New - Decision on date format, timezone handling, and storage approach

## Notes
Following React Router Framework Mode with domain-driven design patterns per constitution. Task entity will follow Zod schema validation with Factory/Repository pattern. UI will use shadcn/ui components with CSS modules for layout.
