# Specification: todo

**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Execution Flow
```
1. Parse user description from change history/input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, leave it as "N/A" for future potential application

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Primary User Story
<!-- The main value proposition from the user's perspective -->
As a user, I want to manage my personal tasks with a todo application so that I can track what needs to be done, organize tasks by priority, and ensure nothing important is forgotten.

## Acceptance Scenarios
<!-- Specific testable scenarios that define success -->

1. **Given** I have no tasks, **When** I create a new task with name, priority, and due date, **Then** the task appears in my task list
2. **Given** I have an existing task, **When** I click on the task, **Then** I see a detailed view with edit capabilities
3. **Given** I am viewing a task detail, **When** I edit the task name, priority, or due date and save, **Then** the task is updated with new values
4. **Given** I have a task in my list, **When** I mark it as done, **Then** the task status changes to completed
5. **Given** I have a completed task, **When** I mark it as undone, **Then** the task status changes back to pending
6. **Given** I have a task I no longer need, **When** I delete the task, **Then** it is removed from my task list permanently
7. **Given** I have multiple tasks, **When** I view my task list, **Then** I can see all tasks with their names, priorities, due dates, and completion status

## Edge Cases
<!-- Error conditions, boundary cases, and failure modes -->

### Error Handling
- **Case**: User attempts to create a task with empty name
  - **Expected**: System displays validation error and prevents task creation
- **Case**: User attempts to set due date in the past
  - **Expected**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should past due dates be allowed or blocked?]
- **Case**: User attempts to delete a task but operation fails
  - **Expected**: System displays error message and task remains in list

### Boundary Conditions  
- **Case**: Task name exceeds maximum character limit
  - **Expected**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the maximum task name length?]
- **Case**: User has very large number of tasks (100+ tasks)
  - **Expected**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should performance and display be handled for large task lists?]
- **Case**: No tasks exist in the system
  - **Expected**: Empty state message displayed with option to create first task

## Functional Requirements
<!-- What the system must do - avoid technical implementation details -->

### Core Requirements
1. The system must allow users to create new tasks with name, priority, and due date
2. The system must display all tasks in a list view showing essential information
3. The system must provide detailed view of individual tasks with edit capabilities
4. The system must allow users to toggle task completion status (done/undone)
5. The system must allow users to permanently delete tasks
6. The system must validate task data before saving
7. The system must persist tasks so they remain available across sessions

### Business Rules
1. Every task must have a name (required field)
2. Priority and due date are mandatory fields for each task
3. Task completion status defaults to "undone" when created
4. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the valid priority values - Low/Medium/High or numerical scale?]
5. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should timezone handling work for due dates?]

## Key Entities
<!-- Important data objects and their relationships -->

### Entity: Task
- **Purpose**: Represents a single todo item that a user needs to complete
- **Key Attributes**: 
  - Name (text, required)
  - Priority ([NEEDS CLARIFICATION: enum values or scale])
  - Due Date (date, required)
  - Completion Status (boolean, defaults to false)
  - Created Date (timestamp, auto-generated)
  - Modified Date (timestamp, auto-updated)
- **Relationships**: Standalone entity with no relationships to other entities in this initial version

## Success Criteria
<!-- How to measure if this specification is properly implemented -->
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios pass
- [ ] All edge cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] All functional requirements are met
- [ ] All business rules are enforced
